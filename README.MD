Project Overview
College events like tech fests, workshops, and cultural activities collect feedback â€” but are we using it meaningfully?

In this project, interns will analyze text and rating-based feedback submitted by students after attending campus events. Youâ€™ll work with simulated or real Google Forms data (CSV) and use basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

ðŸŽ¯ What Youâ€™ll Do
âœ… Clean and prepare feedback data (from a Google Form export)
âœ… Analyze ratings (1â€“5 scale) to find patterns of satisfaction
âœ… Use NLP tools to score sentiment in comments (positive/neutral/negative)
âœ… Visualize trends with beautiful charts and graphs
âœ… Suggest improvements for future events
ðŸ§  Skills Youâ€™ll Gain
Data cleaning & preparation with pandas
Sentiment analysis using TextBlob or VADER
Creating bar charts, pie charts, word clouds for reports
Interpreting survey data to help make real decisions
Working in Google Colab (no software installation!)
